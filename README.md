# how to install/use?

First off, you have to install AutoIT ==> https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

Basically, the AutoIT programming language is a BASIC-like scripting language designed for automating the Windows GUI and general scripting.


Then install it, then install the file (ofc), then click on it

If you have a simple image to try, then select it...

Then you can change the settings and options for your preference, if you have any questions or suggestions, create a new issue..
